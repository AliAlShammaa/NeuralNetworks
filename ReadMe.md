# NeuralNetworks

This Repo contains my work on Neural Networks. As of Sep 12, 2021, it includes comprehensive work on :

- Feed Forward NN (./ANN)
- Convolutioal Neural Networks (./CNN)
- A collection of **Mathemtical notes** on Machine learning Basics and Deep learning including **Calculus** and **Linear Algebra** of **ANN** and **CNN**

The above in addition to other online sources including **Andrew Ng** courses have been my guide through this learning journey


Results of the Networks:
 - CNN From Scartch 90% success rate on odd MNIST
 - Achieved 97% on MNIST with ANN. Achieved, 53% and 78% on CIFAR-10 with ANN and CNN respectively.






**All Neural Network testing results are based on validation-based training
